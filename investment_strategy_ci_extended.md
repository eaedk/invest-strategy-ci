## ðŸ”¢ Expected Annual Returns by Asset Class

| Asset | Expected Annual Return | Notes |
|-------|-----------------------|-------|
| Savings account | 2â€“3â€¯% | Accessible, low risk |
| Term deposit | 4â€“6â€¯% | Fixed rate, low risk |
| Bonds (BRVM) | 6â€“8â€¯% | Government & corporate |
| Global ETF | 8â€“12â€¯% | Diversified international equities |

## ðŸ§® Understanding Compound Interest

Future value of regular monthly contributions:

\[
FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r/12)^{12t} - 1}{r/12}
\]

Where:

- **P** = monthly contribution  
- **r** = annual return (decimal)  
- **t** = number of years

## ðŸš€ Actionable Allocation Example

| Asset Class | Allocation | Expected Weighted Return |
|-------------|-----------:|--------------------------|
| Savings/Emergency | 20â€¯% | ~3â€¯% |
| Bonds & Term Deposits | 30â€¯% | ~6â€¯% |
| Global ETF & Stocks | 30â€¯% | ~10â€¯% |
| Real Estate | 20â€¯% | ~11â€¯% |
| **Blended Portfolio** | **100â€¯%** | **â‰ˆ8â€¯%** |

At an average 8â€¯% return, investing 60â€¯000â€¯FCFA monthly would grow to **â‰ˆÂ â‚£116â€¯M** after 20Â years.
